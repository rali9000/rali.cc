# rali.cc
Website can be found at https://rali.cc/.
A repository containing all the code used for my personal/portfolio website, without including the high quality assets.

This current version is under construction! Currently past the home page I am using a recolored and slightly updated version of rali.cc 2.0.

## Known issues:
Some pages still use pages from an older version of the website
Programming page yet to be created
Placeholder images from unsplash to be replaced
